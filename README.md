# Clock Web App
### A fun clock web app that tells you the time and provides cool motivations to power you through the day
### Built with React and Tailwind CSS for styling

This is the first project I built using Tailwind, and it was a fun experience (I wrote almost no custom CSS ðŸ˜…).

### Basic Functionality
- **Time Display**: Shows the time in your specific location using the `moment.js` package (which solved most of the project's challenges).
- **Motivational Quotes**: Provides fun quotes to motivate you throughout the day, using a really fun API (I especially like this API because it also generates anime quotes, including some from my favorite anime, `Naruto`).

### The Aim of This Project
- To learn Tailwind CSS
- To explore advanced React concepts like using custom hooks, memoization, and understanding when and when not to use `useEffect`
